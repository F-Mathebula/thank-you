# 💖 Thank You Website

## About

This is a small website I created to thank someone who inspired me to start coding. Their encouragement made a big difference in my journey, and this is my way of showing appreciation using the skills they helped me believe I could learn.

The site is built with simple HTML and CSS, featuring a short animated message and a clean, heartfelt design.


## Made with love and gratitude ❤️
